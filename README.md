<h3> ðŸ“„ Introduction</h3>
The goal of this project is to create a credit default classification model using a tree-based algorithm. The model will be trained on a dataset of past customer records, including both defaulters and non-defaulters, with the aim of predicting the likelihood of future default. Relevant features extracted from the dataset will be utilized to ensure accurate classification.
    
The response variable used is "payment_default", where a value of 1 indicates that the customer defaulted and a value of 0 represents that the customer did not default.

Tree based algorithms such as CART(Classification and Regression tree) and Random forest is applied on dataset for classification.
